# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with **React 18** using **Vite** as the build tool and development server. The application follows a component-based architecture with:

- **Routing**: Uses Wouter for lightweight client-side routing with pages for intro, app-links, landing, and dashboard
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state management, caching, and real-time data synchronization
- **UI Framework**: Shadcn/UI components built on Radix UI primitives with Tailwind CSS for styling using a dark theme with custom color variables
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript implementation for type safety across the entire frontend

The frontend structure follows a modular design with dashboard components organized by feature:
- Dashboard layout with responsive 12-column grid system
- Real-time metrics visualization with animated progress bars
- Notification feed with AI analysis and source app integration
- Task workflow management system ("WorkflowRiver") with priority-based organization
- Connected app launcher for quick access to workplace tools
- Wellness and performance monitoring panels with focus scoring

## Backend Architecture

The backend is an **Express.js** server with TypeScript, structured around:

- **RESTful API**: Express routes for CRUD operations on users, tasks, notifications, connected apps, user metrics, and AI insights
- **Database Layer**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL for data persistence using Neon serverless database
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini AI integration for notification analysis, workflow optimization, and wellness insights
- **Session Management**: Connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL-based session storage
- **Development Setup**: Vite integration for hot module replacement in development with custom logging middleware

Key backend features include:
- OAuth integration for Gmail and other workplace applications
- Real-time notification processing and AI analysis
- Task workflow optimization algorithms
- Performance metrics calculation and wellness insights generation

## Database Schema

The PostgreSQL database uses Drizzle ORM with the following key entities:

- **Users**: Core user profiles with authentication data, roles, and profile information
- **Tasks**: Workflow tasks with priority levels (urgent/important/normal), status tracking (pending/in_progress/completed/paused), time estimates, and due dates
- **Notifications**: Cross-platform notifications with AI analysis metadata, priority classification, and source app integration
- **Connected Apps**: Integration status for external workplace applications (Gmail, Slack, Notion, Trello, Zoom, Calendar)
- **User Metrics**: Performance analytics including focus scores, workload capacity, stress levels, and wellness tracking data
- **AI Insights**: Machine learning-generated recommendations for workflow optimization, deadline alerts, and wellness suggestions
- **User App Links**: Custom app links and integrations for personalized workspace access

Schema includes proper foreign key relationships, PostgreSQL enums for standardized values (including 'manual' for user-created tasks), automatic timestamp tracking, and UUID primary keys for scalability.

## Portability Features

âœ… **Database Independence**: Uses Drizzle ORM for database-agnostic operations
âœ… **Environment Configuration**: All API keys and secrets managed through environment variables
âœ… **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation between frontend, backend, and database layers
âœ… **Docker Ready**: Project structure supports containerization for deployment
âœ… **Migration Support**: Database schema changes handled through Drizzle migrations
âœ… **Complete Documentation**: Full setup and deployment instructions included
